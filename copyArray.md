In this update to the Main.java file, I implemented the following enhancements:

Simplified Imports: I reduced the number of import statements by utilizing only one import statement, import java.util.Arrays;, which is sufficient for array operations in the program.

User Input Functionality: I added functionality to allow users to input the size of the array and its elements dynamically.
This makes the program more interactive and flexible, as users can specify the array size at runtime.

Array Display: I utilized the Arrays.toString() method to provide a clear and concise output for displaying both the original and copied arrays.
This improves the readability of the output and makes it easier for users to verify the contents of the arrays.

Overall, these changes enhance the user experience and maintain the program's functionality while improving code efficiency.
